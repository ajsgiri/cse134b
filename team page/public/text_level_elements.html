	<p><span style="color: red;"> Cats</span>, not to be confused with <dfn><abbr title="Charlotte Area Transport System"> CATS</abbr></dfn>, the Charlotte Area Transport System, are quite cuddly creatures.</p>

	<pre><code>
		const numCats = 1;
		numCats = numCats++;
		const numCats = log<sub>10</sub>500;
	</code></pre>

	<p> There are <var> numCats </var> number of cats in the room. In this case, there were <samp> Segmentation Fault: Core Dumped </samp> cat(s) in the room. </p>

	<pre><code>
		const numCats = 1;
		numCats = numCats++;
		<mark>const numCats = log<sub>10</sub>500;</mark>
	</code></pre>
	<p> Notice above in the code how numCats is declared twice, which will cause problems sometimes, probably.</p>
